  abstract = {Organs are formed from multiple cell types that make distinct contributions to their shape. The Drosophila egg chamber provides a tractable model to dissect such contributions during morphogenesis. Egg chambers are comprised of 16 germ cells (GCs) surrounded by a somatic epithelium. Initially spherical, these structures elongate as they mature. This morphogenesis is thought to occur through a ``molecular corset'' mechanism, wherein structural elements within the epithelium become circumferentially organized perpendicular to the elongation axis and resist the expansive growth of the GCs to promote elongation. Whether this epithelial organization provides the hypothesized constraining force has been difficult to discern, however, and a role for GC growth has not been demonstrated. Here we provide evidence for this mechanism by altering the contractile activity of the tubular muscle sheath that surrounds developing egg chambers. Muscle hypo-contraction indirectly reduces GC growth and shortens the egg, which demonstrates the necessity of GC growth for elongation. Conversely, muscle hyper-contraction enhances the elongation program. Although this is an abnormal function for this muscle, this observation suggests that a corset-like force from the egg chamber's exterior could promote its lengthening. These findings highlight how physical contributions from several cell types are integrated to shape an organ.},

Here, we use the acyl resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) assay to demonstrate S-acylation of SOD1 in human post-mortem spinal cord homogenates from ALS and non-ALS subjects. Acyl-RAC further revealed that endogenous copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) is S-acylated in both human and mouse spinal cords, and               in vitro               in HEK293 cells. SOD1 and CCS formed a highly stable heterodimer in human spinal cord homogenates that was resistant to dissociation by boiling, denaturants, or reducing agents and was not observed               in vitro               unless both SOD1 and CCS were overexpressed. Cysteine mutations that attenuate SOD1 maturation prevented the SOD1-CCS heterodimer formation. The degree of S-acylation was highest for SOD1-CCS heterodimers, intermediate for CCS monomers, and lowest for SOD1 monomers. Given that S-acylation facilitates anchoring of soluble proteins to cell membranes, our findings suggest that S-acylation and membrane localization may play an important role in CCS-mediated SOD1 maturation. Furthermore, the highly stable S-acylated SOD1-CCS heterodimer may serve as a long-lived maturation intermediate in human spinal cord.},

Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards are a useful sampling collecting device for dry blood spot (DBS) storage, especially for low and middle-income countries (LMIC). In this study, we analyzed viral HCV RNA integrity for long-term storage at room temperature compared to -~20~{$^\circ$}C using two different types of cards for DBS: FTA Classic and 903 Protein Saver cards. For this purpose, DBS were prepared on these cards using blood or plasma samples from HCV infected patients, and samples were analysed by conventional RT-PCR. Our results showed that 903 Protein Saver cards are the best and cheapest alternative for DBS storage at room temperature. In these conditions, we found that HCV RNA integrity lasted for up to 9~months.},

Two cysteine residues in SOD1 form an intramolecular disulfide bond. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of SOD1 filament formation by cysteine overoxidation in sporadic ALS (sALS). In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the double mutant (C57D/C146D) SOD1 that mimics the overoxidation of the disulfide-forming cysteine residues. The structure revealed the open and relaxed conformation of loop IV containing the mutated Asp57. The double mutant SOD1 produced more contagious filaments than wild-type protein, promoting filament formation of the wild-type SOD1 proteins. Importantly, we further found that HOCl treatment to the wild-type SOD1 proteins facilitated their filament formation. We propose a feasible mechanism for SOD1 filament formation in ALS from the wild-type SOD1, suggesting that overoxidized SOD1 is a triggering factor of sALS. Our findings extend our understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders associated with ROS stresses at the molecular level.},

The synergy between electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and NMR is fully exploited. This is an in vitro study of this process at the molecular level. Domain 1 of hCCS is necessary to load hSOD1 with Cu(I), requiring the heterodimeric complex formation with hSOD1 fostered by the interaction with domain 2.

Many herbicides used for weed control inhibit PSII by interfering with the photosynthetic electron transport at the level of the D1 protein, through competition with the native plastoquinone for the QB site. Molecular details of the interaction of these herbicides in the D1 QB site remain to be elucidated in plants. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effect on plant PSII of the PSII-inhibiting herbicides diuron, metobromuron, bentazon, terbuthylazine and metribuzin. We combined analysis of OJIP chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics and PSII activity assays performed on thylakoid membranes isolated from pea plants with molecular docking using the high-resolution PSII structure recently solved from the same plant. Both approaches showed for terbuthylazine, metribuzin and diuron the highest affinity for the D1 QB site, with the latter two molecules forming hydrogen bonds with His215. Conversely, they revealed for bentazon the lowest PSII inhibitory effect accompanied by a general lack of specificity for the QB site and for metobromuron an intermediate behavior. These results represent valuable information for future design of more selective herbicides with enhanced QB binding affinities to be effective in reduced amounts.},

The aim of the study was to analyze the relations between individual               SOD1               mutations and the clinical presentation using in silico methods to assess the               SOD1               mutations severity. We identified               SOD1               causative variants in a group of 915 prospectively tested consecutive Polish ALS patients from a neuromuscular clinical center, performed molecular modeling of mutated               SOD1               proteins and in silico analysis of mutation impact on clinical phenotype and survival analysis of associations between mutations and hazard of clinical end-points. Fifteen               SOD1               mutations were identified in 21.1\% familial and 2.3\% sporadic ALS cases. Their effects on SOD1 protein structure and functioning inferred from molecular modeling and in silico analyses correlate well with the clinical data. Molecular modeling results support the hypothesis that folding intermediates rather than mature SOD1 protein give rise to the source of cytotoxic conformations in ALS. Significant associations between type of mutation and clinical end-points were found.},

  abstract = {Zinc (II) ions (hereafter simplified as zinc) are important for the structural and functional activity of many proteins. For Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1), zinc stabilizes the native structure of each Sod1 monomer, promotes homo-dimerization and plays an important role in activity by "softening" the active site so that copper cycling between Cu(I) and Cu(II) can rapidly occur. Previously, we have reported that binding of Sod1 by its copper chaperone (Ccs) stabilizes a conformation of Sod1 that promotes site-specific high-affinity zinc binding. While there are a multitude of Sod1 mutations linked to the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), characterizations by multiple research groups have been unable to realize strong commonalities among mutants. Here, we examine a set of fALS-linked Sod1 mutations that have been well-characterized and are known to possess variation in their biophysical characteristics. The zinc affinities of these mutants are evaluated here for the first time and then compared with the previously established value for wild-type Sod1 zinc affinity. Ccs does not have the same ability to promote zinc binding to these mutants as it does for the wild-type version of Sod1. Our data provides a deeper look into how (non)productive Sod1 maturation by Ccs may link a diverse set of fALS-Sod1 mutations.},

Currently, existing populations have little chance to survive without artificial breeding and sustainable ranching programmes. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is regulating international trade of all Acipenseriformes and their products for effective conservation. The aim of this review paper was to describe the main innovative applications in sturgeon aquaculture and conservation, such as genome engineering techniques applied in sturgeon's reproduction, molecular and ploidy analyses of embryo and larvae, sex determination, genome sequencing, gene expression analysis and genome transplantations. Further research is required to improve cryopreservation techniques, embryo banking and quick identification of disease in sturgeon aquaculture and conservation programme.},

  abstract = {Sturgeons are a type of subcold water fish distributed in eastern Europe, on both sides of the North Pacific, in eastern Asia, in western North America, and on the east coast of North America. Its production capacity is strong, and it is easy to breed. However, the sturgeon industry has the problems of a single product structure, a short industrial chain and poor market sales. In this context, developing the sturgeon industry is crucial to research the nutritional value of sturgeon processing byproducts and developing diversified products. Therefore, this paper summarizes the research on the nutritional value of sturgeon processing byproducts and the current situation of processing and utilization over the past 10 years. First, CiteSpace visual analysis software and the bibliometric analysis platform were used to analyze the status of sturgeon research. The Web of Science (WOS) database was used as the literature source to fit the keywords of sturgeon literature in the past ten years. After excluding the two keywords sturgeon and sturgeon meat, the relevant literature is analyzed and sorted, focusing on the literature in the last five years. Second, a comprehensive and in-depth review (sturgeon, processing, byproducts as the keywords to search Google Scholar and Web of Science) was conducted on the research of the nutritional components contained in sturgeon and the processing of nutritional components in byproducts to provide a reliable reference for the research and processing of the sturgeon industry.},

It can persist in the environment for days or months, and its intensive and large-scale use can constitute a major environmental and health problem. In this systematic review, we investigate the current state of our knowledge related to the effects of this pesticide on the nervous system of various animal species and humans. The information provided indicates that exposure to glyphosate or its commercial formulations induces several neurotoxic effects. It has been shown that exposure to this pesticide during the early stages of life can seriously affect normal cell development by deregulating some of the signaling pathways involved in this process, leading to alterations in differentiation, neuronal growth, and myelination. Glyphosate also seems to exert a significant toxic effect on neurotransmission and to induce oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, processes that lead to neuronal death due to autophagy, necrosis, or apoptosis, as well as the appearance of behavioral and motor disorders. The doses of glyphosate that produce these neurotoxic effects vary widely but are lower than the limits set by regulatory agencies. Although there are important discrepancies between the analyzed findings, it is unequivocal that exposure to glyphosate produces important alterations in the structure and function of the nervous system of humans, rodents, fish, and invertebrates.},

  abstract = {Summary                            All-female culture of sturgeon is essential for efficient caviar production. However, Russian sturgeon (               Acipenser gueldenstaedtii               ) does not exhibit external sexual dimorphism, and therefore, commercial farms apply gonadal endoscopy or ultrasound at the earliest age of 4--5~years to separate the sexes, with {\textasciitilde}90\% accuracy. Recently, a dominant genomic marker (               AllWSEX2               ) has been found with association to femaleness in sturgeons. We developed a duplex PCR               (dAllWSEX2)               with the adjacent               bmp7               ~gene as an internal control, to validate an effective PCR. Robust amplification of control fragments was observed for all samples of our commercial               A               .               gueldenstaedtii               stock (               n               ~=~337). The               dAllWSEX2               assay was significantly associated with sex (               n               ~=~43,               p               ~{$<~$}1.6~{\texttimes}~10               -8               ), yet four (18\%) of the endoscopy-determined females were genetic males. To examine whether some females display a male genetic profile, we tested 96 egg-producing females, which were all verified as genetic females, indicating that the observed mismatches may be attributed to wrong sexing by endoscopy. Application of               dAllWSEX2               on 100~7-month-old fish showed no sex-dependent differences in body weight, indicating that weighing is not an applicable tool for sorting females at a young age. Sanger sequencing of the               bmp7               fragment revealed octaploidy and sex-independent variation, suggesting that the critical sex-determining region harboring               AllWSEX2               is small. In keeping with a model of a single-ploidy encoding female determination,               AllWSEX2               ~showed no variation despite being a transposase-linked repetitive element. Cross-species conservation of               AllWSEX2               , and absence of annotated sex-determination genes in this region suggests that, in sturgeons, the sex-determining mechanism is different from mechanisms identified in other fish.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Ammonium is one of the major nutrients for plants, and a ubiquitous intermediate in plant metabolism, but it is also known to be toxic to many organisms, in particular to plants and oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms. Although previous studies revealed a link between ammonium toxicity and photodamage in cyanobacteria under               in vivo               conditions, ammonium-induced photodamage of photosystem               II               (               PSII               ) has not yet been investigated with isolated thylakoid membranes. We show here that ammonium directly accelerated photodamage of               PSII               in                                S                 ynechocystis                              sp. strain               PCC               6803, rather than affecting the repair of photodamaged               PSII               . Using isolated thylakoid membranes, it could be demonstrated that ammonium-induced photodamage of               PSII               primarily occurred at the oxygen evolution complex, which has a known binding site for ammonium.

Ammonium tolerance requires all three                                psbA                              genes since mutants of any of the three single                                psbA                              genes are more sensitive to ammonium than wild-type cells.

Whereas ammonium does not affect the repair of               PSII               photodamage, all three               psbA               genes contribute to ammonium tolerance in               S               ynechocystis               PCC               6803 and thus to the repair of ammonium-photodamaged               PSII               .},

  abstract = {Abstract             The WHO reported that high blood pressure (BP) is one of the primary causes of death worldwide. Hypertension (HPT) is a major risk factor for CVD and related diseases as well as for diseases, leading to a considerable increase in cardiovascular risk. Since BP response could also be influenced by caffeine, which is widely consumed with coffee and other items, it is important to define the possible effects associated with caffeine intake. The most recent findings aimed at clarifying the role of caffeine consumption on BP and HPT risk/incidence are conflicting and difficult to interpret. Therefore, in the present narrative review, we aimed to examine various methodological inaccuracies/aspects and factors that make studies difficult to be compared, in order to obtain a single consensus on the effects of caffeine intake on the risk of BP and HPT. We observed that this heterogeneity in results could be due to the presence of: (i) several variables affecting BP (such as age, sex, genetic and lifestyle aspects); (ii) different caffeine content of food and beverages; and (iii) caffeine metabolism. Moreover, different methodological aspects in the evaluation of daily dietary caffeine intake and in the BP measurement could add some other bias in the interpretation of results. Therefore, it is mandatory to consider all methodological aspects and confounding factors to generate a standardised methodology in order to increase cross-study consistency and minimise confounding effects of different variables on the relationship between BP response and HPT risk/incidence after caffeine intake.},

  abstract = {Misfolding and aggregation of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in neuronal death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Each SOD1 monomer binds to 1 copper and 1 zinc ion and maintains its disulfide bond (Cys-57--Cys-146) in the reducing cytoplasm of cell. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that metal loss and/or disulfide reduction are important for initiating misfolding and aggregation of SOD1. To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD1 folding, we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide-reduced environments in computational simulations. We use all-atom discrete molecular dynamics for sampling. Our simulation results provide dynamical evidence to the stabilizing role of metal ions in both dimer and monomer SOD1. The disulfide bond anchors a loop (Glu-49 to Asn-53) that contributes to the dimer interface. The reduction of the disulfide bond in SOD1 with metal ions depleted results in a flexible Glu-49--Asn-53 loop, which, in turn, disrupts dimer formation. Interestingly, the disulfide bond reduction does not affect the thermostability of monomer SOD1 as significantly as the metal ions do. We further study the structural dynamics of metal-free SOD1 monomers, the precursor for aggregation, in simulations and find inhomogeneous local unfolding of {$\beta$}-strands. The strands protected by the metal-binding and electrostatic loops are found to unfold first after metal loss, leading to a partially unfolded {$\beta$}-sheet prone to aggregation. Our simulation study sheds light on the critical role of metals and disulfide bond in SOD1 folding and aggregation.},

Transition metal complexes are highly promising PDT agents due to intense visible light absorption, yet the majority are toxic even without light. This study introduces a small, photostable, charge-neutral platinum-based compound, Pt(II) 2,6-dipyrido-4-methyl-benzenechloride, complex               1               , as a photosensitizer, which works under               visible               light. Activation of the new photosensitizer at low concentrations (0.1--1\,{$\mu$}M) by comparatively low dose of 405\,nm light (3.6\,J cm               -2               ) causes significant cell death of cervical, colorectal and bladder cancer cell lines, and, importantly, a cisplatin resistant cell line EJ-R. The photo-index of the complex is 8. We demonstrate that complex               1               induces irreversible DNA single strand breaks following irradiation, and that oxygen is essential for the photoinduced action. Neither light, nor compound alone led to cell death. The key advantages of the new drug include a remarkably fast accumulation time (diffusion-controlled, minutes), and photostability. This study demonstrates a highly promising new agent for photodynamic therapy, and attracts attention to photostable metal complexes as viable alternatives to conventional chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin.},

In addition to providing energy, the breakdown of ATP through hydrolysis serves a broad range of cell functions, including signaling and DNA/RNA synthesis. ATP synthesis utilizes energy obtained from multiple catabolic mechanisms, including cellular respiration, beta-oxidation, and ketosis. The majority of ATP synthesis occurs in cellular respiration within the mitochondrial matrix: generating approximately thirty-two ATP molecules per molecule of glucose that is oxidized. ATP is consumed for energy in processes including ion transport, muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, substrate phosphorylation, and chemical synthesis. These processes, as well as others, create a high demand for ATP. As a result, cells within the human body depend upon the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles of ATP per day to ensure proper functioning. In the forthcoming sections, ATP will undergo further evaluation of its role as a crucial molecule in the daily functioning of the cell.},

In the case of the sturgeon, sex determination is most likely of genetic origin and is characterized by a               ZW               female heterogametic system. However, molecular mechanisms of sex development and differentiation in sturgeons are poorly understood. Due to the lack of sexual dimorphism and a long period of maturation combined with invaluable caviar obtained from sturgeons, plenty of research revolving around discovering master sex-determining gene has been done. Yet, despite numerous studies utilizing multiple approaches and techniques to find key genes involved in sex differentiation, no master sex-determining genes were identified in sturgeons. Nevertheless, the latest research provided a great deal of data regarding the expression of genes commonly related with sex development and differentiation in vertebrates. Several of these genes were found to be connected with the same processes in sturgeons. This review attempts to summarize research into the expression of genes involved in sex differentiation and development in sturgeons.},

The disappearance of acid or alkali from the mucosal solution of short-circuited tissue was measured with a pH stat while the serosal pH was kept at 7.4. The duodenum rapidly disposed of both acid and alkali; neither property was altered by gassing with N2 while iodoacetate was in the perfusing solutions. Prevention of release of CO2 from the mucosal chamber obliterated the early rapid phase of acid disposal by the mucosa while a similar maneuver in the serosal chamber increased the appearance of serosal acid without altering the rate of acid disposal. Gut sacs of rabbit duodenum in vitro and in vivo showed a positive correlation between acid disposal and the rate of luminal CO2 production. While acid disposal progressively decreased with time for the in vitro gut sacs, the in vivo gut sac showed no fatigue in this respect. Luminal acidification in the Ussing chamber was associated with a profound reduction in short-circuit current (Isc), partially reversible by elevation of the mucosal pH but not by luminal glucose. Our data suggest that acid disposal occurs in part by intraluminal neutralization and in part by diffusion into the mucosa.},

In this work, we incorporated cisplatin into an AIE-based photosensitizer (BT) and achieved a highly efficient antitumor drug (BT-Pt). Possessing AIE characteristics, BT-Pt exhibited NIR fluorescence with large Stokes shift in cells, which can guide the location of the drug. More importantly, the ROS generation efficiency of BT-Pt has extremely been promoted with the fabrication of cisplatin, compared with BT. As a result, BT-Pt demonstrated favorable therapeutic efficacy with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 1.54 {$\mu$}M for HeLa cells upon white light irradiation, attributed to its synergetic PDT and chemotherapy. The design strategy of such platinated photosensitizer showed great potential in developing multifunctional anticancer drugs with combinatorial photodynamic--chemotherapy, especially when ablating cisplatin resistant cancer cells and hypoxic tumors.},

DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways help organisms minimize adverse effects of DNA alterations. In terms of DNA repair mechanisms, sturgeons represent a particularly interesting model due to their exceptional genome plasticity. Sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) is a relatively small species of sturgeon. The goal of this study was to assess the sensitivity of sterlet embryos to model genotoxicants (camptothecin, etoposide, and benzo[a]pyrene), and to assess DDR responses. We assessed the effects of genotoxicants on embryo survival, hatching rate, DNA fragmentation, gene expression, and phosphorylation of H2AX and ATM kinase. Exposure of sterlet embryos to 1 {\textmu}M benzo[a]pyrene induced low levels of DNA damage accompanied by ATM phosphorylation and xpc gene expression. Conversely, 20 {\textmu}M etoposide exposure induced DNA damage without activation of known DDR pathways. Effects of 10 nM camptothecin on embryo development were stage-specific, with early stages, before gastrulation, being most sensitive. Overall, this study provides foundational information for future investigation of sterlet DDR pathways.},

While the illumination required to activate a PS imparts a certain amount of selectivity to PDT treatments, poor tumor accumulation and cell internalization are still inherent properties of most intravenously administered PSs. As a result, common consequences of PDT include skin photosensitivity. To overcome the mentioned issues, PSs may be tailored to specifically target overexpressed biomarkers of tumors. This active targeting can be achieved by direct conjugation of the PS to a ligand with enhanced affinity for a target overexpressed on cancer cells and/or other cells of the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, PSs may be incorporated into ligand-targeted nanocarriers, which may also encompass multi-functionalities, including diagnosis and therapy. In this review, we highlight the major advances in active targeting of PSs, either by means of ligand-derived bioconjugates or by exploiting ligand-targeting nanocarriers.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Diurnal dark to light transition causes profound physiological changes in plant metabolism. These changes require distinct modes of regulation as a unique feature of photosynthetic lifestyle. The activities of several key metabolic enzymes are regulated by light-dependent post-translational modifications (PTM) and have been studied at depth at the level of individual proteins. In contrast, a global picture of the light-dependent PTMome dynamics is lacking, leaving the response of a large proportion of cellular function undefined. Here, we investigated the light-dependent metabolome and proteome changes in Arabidopsis rosettes in a time resolved manner to dissect their kinetic interplay, focusing on phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, and cysteine-based redox switches. Of over 24\,000 PTM sites that were detected, more than 1700 were changed during the transition from dark to light. While the first changes, as measured 5\,min after onset of illumination, occurred mainly in the chloroplasts, PTM changes at proteins in other compartments coincided with the full activation of the Calvin--Benson cycle and the synthesis of sugars at later timepoints. Our data reveal connections between metabolism and PTM-based regulation throughout the cell. The comprehensive multiome profiling analysis provides unique insight into the extent by which photosynthesis reprograms global cell function and adds a powerful resource for the dissection of diverse cellular processes in the context of photosynthetic function.},

To achieve this goal, a normal human heart must beat regularly and continuously for one's entire life. Heartbeats originate from the rhythmic pacing discharge from the sinoatrial (SA) node within the heart itself. In the absence of extrinsic neural or hormonal influences, the SA node pacing rate would be about 100 beats per minute. Heart rate and cardiac output, however, must vary in response to the needs of the body's cells for oxygen and nutrients under varying conditions. In order to respond rapidly to the changing requirements of the body's tissues, the heart rate and contractility are regulated by the nervous system, hormones, and other factors. Here we review how the cardiovascular system is controlled and influenced by not only a unique intrinsic system, but is also heavily influenced by the autonomic nervous system as well as the endocrine system.},

  abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used as an anti-tumor treatment method for a long time and photosensitizers (PS) can be used in various types of tumors. Originally, light is an effective tool that has been used in the treatment of diseases for ages. The effects of combination of specific dyes with light illumination was demonstrated at the beginning of 20th century and novel PDT approaches have been developed ever since. Main strategies of current studies are to reduce off-target effects and improve pharmacokinetic properties. Given the high interest and vast literature about the topic, approval of PDT as the first drug/device combination by the FDA should come as no surprise. PDT consists of two stages of treatment, combining light energy with a PS in order to destruct tumor cells after activation by light. In general, PDT has fewer side effects and toxicity than chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. In addition to the purpose of treatment, several types of PSs can be used for diagnostic purposes for tumors. Such approaches are called photodynamic diagnosis (PDD). In this Review, we provide a general overview of the clinical applications of PDT in cancer, including the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Assessment of PDT therapeutic efficacy in the clinic will be discussed, since identifying predictors to determine the response to treatment is crucial. In addition, examples of PDT in various types of tumors will be discussed. Furthermore, combination of PDT with other therapy modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and immunotherapy will be emphasized, since such approaches seem to be promising in terms of enhancing effectiveness against tumor. The combination of PDT with other treatments may yield better results than by single treatments. Moreover, the utilization of lower doses in a combination therapy setting may cause less side effects and better results than single therapy. A better understanding of the effectiveness of PDT in a combination setting in the clinic as well as the optimization of such complex multimodal treatments may expand the clinical applications of PDT.},

Despite great advances have been achieved, the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) still cannot satisfy the clinic requirements as the antitumor efficacy could be severely affected by tumor-associated hypoxia. Herein, for the first time, we reported a platinum(IV) complex-based polyprodrug that can in situ generate the highly toxic platinum(II) species as chemotherapeutics and simultaneously induce a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a PDT-like process without the use of photosensitizer and consumption of oxygen. By in situ polymerizing the platinum(IV) complex-based prodrug monomer (PPM) and 2methacryloyloxy ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), nanosized hydrogel-like polyprodrug could be synthesized. Upon being exposed to light, Pt(IV) moieties in this photoactivable polyprodrug were reduced to generate Pt(II) species. At the meantime, a high level of ROS was generated without the presence of endogenous oxygen, which was confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) and fluorescence probes. With the unique nanosized architecture and photoresponsive feature, the as-synthesized polyprodrug exhibited the advantages of sustained drug release, long-term circulation, preferable tumor accumulation, and reversing drug resistance by downregulating the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in the anticancer treatment.},

Results showed that PDT+LPC significantly reduced the tumor volume by up to {\textasciitilde}112\%. Meanwhile, LPC, PDT+CDDP, or the CDDP group showed {\textasciitilde}98.8\%, {\textasciitilde}73.1\%, or {\textasciitilde}39.5\% volume reductions, respectively. Histological examination suggests that PDT+LPC or LPC treatment showed minimal side effects on renal damage compared to either CDDP or the PDT+CDDP group. Immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) staining on Ki-67, CD31, cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL assays, and western blots of tumor suppressor p53 confirmed consistent results. Most importantly, PDT+LPC prolonged tumor growth inhibition, which leads to minimum chemotherapy treatment administrations. Results suggest that PDT cytotoxicity provided a potent additive effect towards chemotherapy efficacy. Therefore, combined PDT with LPC NPs enhanced the therapeutic outcome in human OSCC.},

  abstract = {To maintain homeostasis, the human body employs many physiological adaptations. One of these is maintaining an acid-base balance. In the absence of pathological states, the pH of the human body ranges between 7.35 to 7.45, with the average at 7.40. Why this number? Why not a neutral number of 7.0 instead of a slightly alkaline 7.40? A pH at this level is ideal for many biological processes, one of the most important being the oxygenation of blood. Also, many of the intermediates of biochemical reactions in the body become ionized at a neutral pH, which causes the utilization of these intermediates to be more difficult. A pH below 7.35 is an acidemia,~and a pH above 7.45 is an alkalemia.~ Due to the importance of sustaining a pH level in the needed narrow range, the human body contains compensatory mechanisms. This discussion intends to impart a basic understanding of acid-base balance in the body while providing a systematic way to approach patients who present with conditions causing alterations in pH. The human body experiences four main types of acid-based~disorders: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. If one of these conditions occurs, the human body should induce a counterbalance in the form of an opposite condition. For example, if a person is experiencing a metabolic acidemia, their body will attempt to induce a respiratory alkalosis to compensate. It is rare for the compensation to make the pH completely normal at 7.4. When using the term acidemia or alkalemia, one is denoting that overall the pH is acidic or alkalotic, respectively. While not necessary, it can be useful to employ this terminology to distinguish between individual processes and the overall pH status of the patient since multiple imbalances can happen at the same time.},

The most important substrates of CK1 kinases are proteins that act in the regulatory nodes essential for tumorigenesis of hematological malignancies. Among those, the most important are the functions of CK1s in the regulation of Wnt pathways, cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy. In this review we summarize the recent developments in the understanding of biology and therapeutic potential of the inhibition of CK1 isoforms in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), other non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM). CK1{$\delta$}/{$\varepsilon$} inhibitors block CLL development in preclinical models via inhibition of WNT-5A/ROR1-driven non-canonical Wnt pathway. While no selective CK1 inhibitors have reached clinical stage to date, one dual PI3K{$\delta$} and CK1{$\varepsilon$} inhibitor, umbralisib, is currently in clinical trials for CLL and NHL patients. In MDS, AML and MM, inhibition of CK1{$\alpha$}, acting via activation of p53 pathway, showed promising preclinical activities and the first CK1{$\alpha$} inhibitor has now entered the clinical trials.},

  abstract = {An original approach intended to facilitate the intratumoral activation of Pt(IV) diamines by illumination with visible light to form photolysis products that irreversibly bind to DNA and are cytotoxic to human cancer cells is reported. The novel Pt(IV) complex trans,cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2-(en)] was prepared by the acetylation of trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)] with acetic anhydride in CH2-Cl2; trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)] was synthesized by oxidation of [PtI2(en)] with 30\% aqueous H2O2. trans,cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2(en)] crystallized from methanol as deep-red needles with a = 9.029(4) A, b = 11.443(2) A, c = 12.822(2) A, beta = 95.48(3) degrees, monoclinic space group Cc, and Z = 4. The conformation of the acetato groups around the O-Pt-O axis deviated significantly from the conformation of the acetato groups in the X-ray crystal structure reported for the cis-dichloro analog, which may explain the very different aqueous solubilities of the two compounds. trans,-cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2(en)] and trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)] displayed broad ligand-to-metal charge-transfer bands centered at lambda = 389 and 384 nm, respectively (epsilon = 1372 and 1425 M-1 cm-1, respectively), with tailing out to ca. 550 nm. When trans,cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2(en)] was incubated with calf thymus DNA in the absence of light, no covalent binding of Pt to DNA was measurable after 6 h; however, irradiation with light of wavelengths {$>$} 375 nm resulted in 63 +/- 13\% of the platinum being covalently bound to DNA after 6 h, suggesting that a photoreduction to Pt(II) species took place. Although trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)] was also labile to visible light, only 10 +/- 2\% DNA platination was observed after 6 h of illumination; however, covalent binding of Pt to DNA took place quantitatively when a reducing agent such as glutathione was added to the photolyzed incubations. These results provide evidence that the photolysis of the trans-dihydroxo analog resulted predominately in the substitution of the iodide ligands for water rather than a reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). When protected from light, trans,cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2-(en)] and trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)], both at a concentration of 10 microM, had half-lives of 6.6 +/- 0.5 and 46.8 +/- 8.8 h, respectively, at 37 degrees C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) containing 5\% fetal calf serum. When irradiated with light lambda(irr) {$>$} 375 nm, the half-lives were decreased by 24- and 53-fold for the diacetato- and dihydroxoplatinum(IV) complexes, respectively. Compared to the "dark" control, the in vitro treatment of TCCSUP human bladder cancer cells with trans,cis-[Pt(OAc)2I2(en)] resulted in 35\% greater growth inhibitory activity when during the first 1.5 h of drug exposure the cells were irradiated with light lambda irr {$>$} 375 nm. The photolysis of trans,cis-[Pt(OH)2I2(en)] with visible light resulted in a 22\% enhancement of antiproliferative activity.},

  abstract = {Several hypotheses explain the prevalence of undifferentiated sex chromosomes in poikilothermic vertebrates. Turnovers change the master sex determination gene, the sex chromosome or the sex determination system (e.g. XY to WZ). Jumping master genes stay main triggers but translocate to other chromosomes. Occasional recombination (e.g. in sex-reversed females) prevents sex chromosome degeneration. Recent research has uncovered conserved heteromorphic or even homomorphic sex chromosomes in several clades of non-avian and non-mammalian vertebrates. Sex determination in sturgeons (Acipenseridae) has been a long-standing basic biological question, linked to economical demands by the caviar-producing aquaculture. Here, we report the discovery of a sex-specific sequence from sterlet (               Acipenser ruthenus               ). Using chromosome-scale assemblies and pool-sequencing, we first identified an approximately 16 kb female-specific region. We developed a PCR-genotyping test, yielding female-specific products in six species, spanning the entire phylogeny with the most divergent extant lineages (               A. sturio, A. oxyrinchus               versus               A. ruthenus, Huso huso               ), stemming from an ancient tetraploidization. Similar results were obtained in two octoploid species (               A. gueldenstaedtii, A. baerii               ). Conservation of a female-specific sequence for a long period, representing 180 Myr of sturgeon evolution, and across at least one polyploidization event, raises many interesting biological questions. We discuss a conserved undifferentiated sex chromosome system with a ZZ/ZW-mode of sex determination and potential alternatives.                          This article is part of the theme issue `Challenging the paradigm in sex chromosome evolution: empirical and theoretical insights with a focus on vertebrates (Part I)'.},

Materials and Methods                                The light output from the selected bioluminescent marker was investigated in several experiments, including: (a)contact with a range of Ca                 2+                 ion concentrations; (b) treatment of extracted teeth with solutions of differing pH, followed by application of the bioluminescence marker to assess Ca                 2+                 ion release; and (c) application of the marker to freshly extracted teeth with natural and artificially created caries lesions on occlusal and smooth surfaces to image the Ca                 2+                 ion distribution.                                                        Results                                The results of: experiment (a) showed that the light output from the marker increases with increasing Ca                 2+                 concentration and of experiment (b) showed increases in light being observed as increasingly acidic solutions were applied.

Conclusions                                These results demonstrate the ability of a novel bioluminescence technology to image Ca                 2+                 ions on tooth enamel surfaces which has potential in dental caries and dental erosion applications and provides the scientific basis for the ongoing development of that novel technology.},

Complexes               4               and               3               are potential precursors of the anticancer drug cisplatin and its inactive               trans               isomer transplatin, respectively. The               trans               complex               3               is octahedral, contains almost linear azide ligands, and adopts a layer structure with extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

In contrast to transplatin, complex               3               rapidly formed a platinum(               II               ) bis(5{$\prime$}-guanosine monophosphate) (5{$\prime$}-GMP) adduct when irradiated with UVA light, and did not react in the dark. Complexes               3               and               4               were non-toxic to human skin cells (keratinocytes) in the dark, but were as cytotoxic as cisplatin on irradiation for a short time (50 min). Damage to the DNA of these cells was detected by using the ``comet'' assay. Both               trans-               and               cis               -diammine platinum(               IV               ) diazide complexes therefore have potential as photochemotherapeutic agents.},

Complex 1 is remarkably stable in the dark, even in the presence of cellular reducing agents such as glutathione, but readily undergoes photoinduced ligand substitution and photoreduction reactions. When 1 is photoactivated in cells, it is highly toxic: 13--80 x more cytotoxic than the Pt               II               anticancer drug cisplatin, and               ca.               15 x more cytotoxic toward cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. Cisplatin targets DNA, and DNA platination levels induced in HaCaT skin cells by 1 were similar to those of cisplatin. However, cisplatin forms mainly intrastrand               cis               diguanine cross-links on DNA between neighboring nucleotides, whereas photoactivated complex 1 rapidly forms unusual               trans               azido/guanine, and then               trans               diguanine Pt               II               adducts, which are probably mainly intrastrand cross-links between two guanines separated by a third base. DNA interstrand and DNA--protein cross-links were also detected. Importantly, DNA repair synthesis on plasmid DNA platinated by photoactivated 1 was markedly lower than for cisplatin or its isomer transplatin (an inactive complex). Single-cell electrophoresis experiments also demonstrated that the DNA damage is different from that induced by cisplatin or transplatin. Cell death is not solely dependent on activation of the caspase 3 pathway, and, in contrast to cisplatin, p53 protein did not accumulate in cells after photosensitization of 1. The               trans               diazido Pt               IV               complex 1 therefore has remarkable properties and is a candidate for use in photoactivated cancer chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {In this review, the general background is provided on cyanobacteria, including morphology, cell membrane structure, and their photosynthesis pathway. The presence of cyanobacteria in nature, and their industrial applications are discussed, and their production of secondary metabolites are explained. Biofilm formation, as a common feature of microorganisms, is detailed and the role of cell diffusion in bacterial colonization is described. Then, the discussion is narrowed down to cyanobacterium Synechocystis, as a lab model microorganism. In this relation, the morphology of Synechocystis is discussed and its different elements are detailed. Type IV pili, the complex multi-protein apparatus for motility and cell-cell adhesion in Synechocystis is described and the underlying function of its different elements is detailed. The phototaxis behavior of the cells, in response to homogenous or directional illumination, is reported and its relation to the run and tumble statistics of the cells is emphasized. In Synechocystis suspensions, there may exist a reciprocal interaction between the cell and the carrying fluid. The effects of shear flow on the growth, doubling per day, biomass production, pigments, and lipid production of Synechocystis are reported. Reciprocally, the effects of Synechocystis presence and its motility on the rheological properties of cell suspensions are addressed. This review only takes up the general grounds of cyanobacteria and does not get into the detailed biological aspects per se. Thus, it is substantially more comprehensive in that sense than other reviews that have been published in the last two decades. It is also written not only for the researchers in the field, but for those in physics and engineering, who may find it interesting, useful, and related to their own research.},

  abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that acts on the central nervous system (CNS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Generally, ACh receptors at the NMJ are nicotinic type while in the CNS and ANS they are usually muscarinic type. As a reminder, these receptors are functionally and structurally different; nicotinic ACh receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, whereas muscarinic ACh receptors are G-protein coupled receptors. Processes that enhance ACh function are termed ``cholinergic'' while processes that inhibit the action of ACh at its receptors are termed ``anticholinergic.'' Anticholinergic effects are most commonly the result of medication. These medications should be more appropriately termed "antimuscarinics," as they usually block muscarinic but not nicotinic receptors. At least 600 drugs/medicinal products are recognized to have anticholinergic activity, and the most common of these are responsible for a significant amount of poisoning admissions. Many also contribute to the development of an anticholinergic reaction: a constellation of symptoms resulting from the antagonism of muscarinic receptors throughout the body. The features of the anticholinergic reaction are deducible from an understanding of the normal function of muscarinic receptors at various organs, and the following mnemonic summarizes these effects: Mad as a hatter (delirium). Blind as a bat (ocular symptoms). Dry as a bone (anhidrosis/dry mouth/dry skin). Hot as a hare (fever). Bloated as a toad (constipation). The heart runs alone (tachycardia). Full as a flask (urinary retention). Red as a beet (cutaneous vasodilation). Clinically the most significant feature is delirium, particularly in the elderly, who are most likely to be affected by the anticholinergic reaction.},

The discovery that mutations in               SOD1               gene cause a subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) has attracted great attention, and studies to date have been mainly focused on discovering mutations in the coding region and investigation at protein level. Considering that changes in SOD1 mRNA levels have been associated with sporadic ALS (SALS), a molecular understanding of the processes involved in the regulation of               SOD1               gene expression could not only unravel novel regulatory pathways that may govern cellular phenotypes and changes in diseases but also might reveal therapeutic targets and treatments. This review seeks to provide an overview of               SOD1               gene structure and of the processes through which SOD1 transcription is controlled. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance to focus future researches on investigating posttranscriptional mechanisms and their relevance to ALS.},

  abstract = {Significance             Increased mortality of honey bee colonies has been attributed to several factors but is not fully understood. The herbicide glyphosate is expected to be innocuous to animals, including bees, because it targets an enzyme only found in plants and microorganisms. However, bees rely on a specialized gut microbiota that benefits growth and provides defense against pathogens. Most bee gut bacteria contain the enzyme targeted by glyphosate, but vary in whether they possess susceptible versions and, correspondingly, in tolerance to glyphosate. Exposing bees to glyphosate alters the bee gut community and increases susceptibility to infection by opportunistic pathogens. Understanding how glyphosate impacts bee gut symbionts and bee health will help elucidate a possible role of this chemical in colony decline.           ,                             Glyphosate, the primary herbicide used globally for weed control, targets the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme in the shikimate pathway found in plants and some microorganisms. Thus, glyphosate may affect bacterial symbionts of animals living near agricultural sites, including pollinators such as bees. The honey bee gut microbiota is dominated by eight bacterial species that promote weight gain and reduce pathogen susceptibility. The gene encoding EPSPS is present in almost all sequenced genomes of bee gut bacteria, indicating that they are potentially susceptible to glyphosate. We demonstrated that the relative and absolute abundances of dominant gut microbiota species are decreased in bees exposed to glyphosate at concentrations documented in the environment. Glyphosate exposure of young workers increased mortality of bees subsequently exposed to the opportunistic pathogen               Serratia marcescens               . Members of the bee gut microbiota varied in susceptibility to glyphosate, largely corresponding to whether they possessed an EPSPS of class I (sensitive to glyphosate) or class II (insensitive to glyphosate). This basis for differences in sensitivity was confirmed using in vitro experiments in which the EPSPS gene from bee gut bacteria was cloned into               Escherichia coli               . All strains of the core bee gut species,               Snodgrassella alvi               , encode a sensitive class I EPSPS, and reduction in               S. alvi               levels was a consistent experimental result. However, some               S. alvi               strains appear to possess an alternative mechanism of glyphosate resistance. Thus, exposure of bees to glyphosate can perturb their beneficial gut microbiota, potentially affecting bee health and their effectiveness as pollinators.},

  abstract = {A period of oocyte growth is followed by a process called oocyte maturation (the resumption of meiosis) which occurs prior to ovulation and is a prerequisite for successful fertilization. Our studies using fish models have revealed that oocyte maturation is a three-step induction process involving gonadotropin (LH), maturation-inducing hormone (MIH), and maturation-promoting factor (MPF). LH acts on the ovarian follicle layer to produce MIH (17{$\alpha$}, 20{$\beta$}-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one, 17{$\alpha$}, 20{$\beta$}-DP, in most fishes). The interaction of ovarian thecal and granulosa cell layers (two-cell type model), is required for the synthesis of 17{$\alpha$},20{$\beta$}-DP. The dramatic increase in the capacity of postvitellogenic follicles to produce 17{$\alpha$},20{$\beta$}-DP in response to LH is correlated with decreases in               P450c17               (               P450c17-I               ) and               P450 aromatase               (               oP450arom               ) mRNA and increases in the novel form of               P450c17               (               P450c17-II               ) and               20{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase               (               20{$\beta$}-HSD               ) mRNA. Transcription factors such as Ad4BP/SF-1, Foxl2, and CREB may be involved in the regulation of expression of these steroidogenic enzymes. A distinct family of G-protein-coupled membrane-bound MIH receptors has been shown to mediate non-genomic actions of 17{$\alpha$}, 20{$\beta$}-DP. The MIH signal induces the               de novo               synthesis of cyclin B from the stored mRNA, which activates a preexisting 35{$\quad$}kDa cdc2 kinase via phosphorylation of its threonine 161 by cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase, thus producing the 34{$\quad$}kDa active cdc2 (active MPF). Upon egg activation, MPF is inactivated by degradation of cyclin B. This process is initiated by the 26S proteasome through the first cut in its NH               2               terminus at lysine 57.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is an herbicide widely used in agriculture but can present chronic toxicity in low concentrations. Artemia salina is a common bio-indicator of ecotoxicity; it was used herein as a model to evaluate the effect of highly diluted-succussed glyphosate (potentized glyphosate) in glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) exposed living systems. Artemia salina cysts were kept in artificial seawater with 0.02\% glyphosate (corresponding to 10\% lethal concentration or LC10) under constant oxygenation, luminosity, and controlled temperature, to promote hatching in 48 h. Cysts were treated with 1\% (v/v) potentized glyphosate in different dilution levels (Gly 6 cH, 30 cH, 200 cH) prepared the day before according to homeopathic techniques, using GBH from the same batch. Controls were unchallenged cysts, and cysts treated with succussed water or potentized vehicle. After 48 h, the number of born nauplii per 100 {\textmu}L, nauplii vitality, and morphology were evaluated. The remaining seawater was used for physicochemical analyses using solvatochromic dyes. In a second set of experiments, Gly 6 cH treated cysts were observed under different degrees of salinity (50 to 100\% seawater) and GBH concentrations (zero to LC 50); hatching and nauplii activity were recorded and analyzed using the ImageJ 1.52, plug-in Trackmate. The treatments were performed blind, and the codes were revealed after statistical analysis. Gly 6 cH increased nauplii vitality (p = 0.01) and improved the healthy/defective nauplii ratio (p = 0.005) but delayed hatching (p = 0.02). Overall, these results suggest Gly 6cH treatment promotes the emergence of the more GBH-resistant phenotype in the nauplii population. Also, Gly 6cH delays hatching, another useful survival mechanism in the presence of stress. Hatching arrest was most marked in 80\% seawater when exposed to glyphosate at LC10. Water samples treated with Gly 6 cH showed specific interactions with solvatochromic dyes, mainly Coumarin 7, such that it appears to be a potential physicochemical marker for Gly 6 cH. In short, Gly 6 cH treatment appears to protect the Artemia salina population exposed to GBH at low concentrations.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol provided by low- or high-density lipoprotein is the precursor for biosynthesis of progesterone. Once inside the cell, cholesterol can be used for steroidogenesis or esterified with long-chain fatty acids and stored as cholesterol esters in lipid droplets. When it is needed for steroidogenesis, free cholesterol is transported to the mitochondrion via a mechanism that involves cytoskeletal elements and sterol carrier proteins. Cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme complex converts the cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is then converted to progesterone by 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta5,delta4 isomerase in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Transport of cholesterol from the cytoplasm to the inner mitochondrial membrane is both the rate-limiting step in progesterone biosynthesis and the step most acutely influenced by second messengers. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are involved in this transport. StAR may bind cholesterol in the cytosol and transport it to the mitochondrial membrane where PBR is involved in transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Phosphorylation of StAR by protein kinase A (PKA) stimulates cholesterol transport, whereas phosphorylation by PKC may inhibit this process. Endozepine, the natural ligand for PBR, also appears to be involved in regulation of the rate of cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane and to play a role in the stimulatory effects of PKA on steroidogenesis. Increased concentrations of endozepine were detected in large luteal cells, and may explain the increased progesterone secretion from this type of cell. Fluorescence energy transfer procedures indicate that StAR associates with PBR in mitochondrial membranes. A model is presented for the proposed interactions of StAR, PBR and endozepine in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane.},

We have generated an               S. cerevisiae               strain in which glucose uptake is dependent on a chimeric hexose transporter mediating reduced sugar uptake. This strain shows a fully respiratory metabolism also at high glucose levels as seen for aerobic organisms, and switches to fermentation only when oxygen is lacking. These observations illustrate that manipulating a single step can alter the mode of metabolism. The novel yeast strain is an excellent tool to study the mechanisms underlying glucose-induced signal transduction.},

  abstract = {Cells are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of mitochondrial metabolism, especially under hypoxia. ROS are also enzymatically generated at the plasma membrane during inflammation. Radicals cause cellular damage leading to cell death, as they react indiscriminately with surrounding lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. However, ROS are also important for many physiological processes, including signaling, pathogen killing and chemotaxis. The sensitivity of cells to ROS therefore likely depends on the subcellular location of ROS production, but how this affects cell viability is poorly understood. As ROS generation consumes oxygen, and hypoxia-mediated signaling upregulates expression of antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, it is difficult to discern hypoxic from radical stress. In this study, we developed an optogenetic toolbox for organelle-specific generation of ROS using the photosensitizer protein SuperNova which produces superoxide anion upon excitation with 590 nm light. We fused SuperNova to organelle specific localization signals to induce ROS with high precision. Selective ROS production did not affect cell viability in most organelles except for the nucleus. SuperNova is a promising tool to induce locally targeted ROS production, opening up new possibilities to investigate processes and organelles that are affected by localized ROS production.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. While the exact causes of ALS are still unclear, the discovery that familial cases of ALS are related to mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a key antioxidant enzyme protecting cells from the deleterious effects of superoxide radicals, suggested that alterations in SOD1 functionality and/or aberrant SOD1 aggregation strongly contribute to ALS pathogenesis. A new scenario was opened in which, thanks to the generation of SOD1 related models, different mechanisms crucial for ALS progression were identified. These include excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctions, and non-cell autonomous toxicity, also implicating altered Ca2+ metabolism. While most of the literature considers motor neurons as primary target of SOD1-mediated effects, here we mainly discuss the effects of SOD1 mutations in non-neuronal cells, such as glial and skeletal muscle cells, in ALS. Attention is given to the altered redox balance and Ca2+ homeostasis, two processes that are strictly related with each other. We also provide original data obtained in primary myocytes derived from hSOD1(G93A) transgenic mice, showing perturbed expression of Ca2+ transporters that may be responsible for altered mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes. ALS-related SOD1 mutants are also responsible for early alterations of fundamental biological processes in skeletal myocytes that may impinge on skeletal muscle functions and the cross-talk between muscle cells and motor neurons during disease progression.},

Production of [               14               C]ornithine preceded that of [               14               C]citrulline, and the patterns of labeled amino acids were similar in cells incubated with               l               -[               14               C]ornithine, suggesting that the reaction of arginase, rendering ornithine and urea, is the main initial step in arginine catabolism. Ornithine followed two metabolic pathways: (i) conversion into citrulline, catalyzed by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and then, with incorporation of aspartate, conversion into argininosuccinate, in a sort of urea cycle, and (ii) a sort of arginase pathway rendering glutamate (and glutamine) via {$\Delta$}               1               pyrroline-5-carboxylate and proline.

During the past decades, diverse methods have been developed to regulate cell behaviors such as applying external stimuli, delivering exogenous molecules into cell interior and changing the physicochemical properties of the substrates where cells adhere. Photothermal scaffolds/surfaces refer to a kind of materials embedded or coated with photothermal agents that can absorb light with proper wavelength (usually in near infrared region) and convert light energy to heat; the generated heat shows great potential for regulation of cell behaviors in different ways. In the current review, we summarize the recent research progress, especially over the past decade, of using photothermal scaffolds/surfaces to regulate cell behaviors, which could be further categorized into three types: (i) killing the tumor cells via hyperthermia or thermal ablation, (ii) engineering cells by intracellular delivery of exogenous molecules via photothermal poration of cell membranes, and (iii) releasing a single cell or an intact cell sheet via modulation of surface physicochemical properties in response to heat. In the end, challenges and perspectives in these areas are commented.},

  abstract = {To determine the prognostic impact of clinical, immunohistochemical, and biological parameters, we examined 52 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) by conventional light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. DNA ploidy was analyzed by image cytometry on cytospin preparation. The proliferative activity was determined by mitosis counting and assessment of Ki-67 reactivity by means of monoclonal antibody Ki-S5. A histopathologic grade was assigned to each tumor according to the French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC) grading system. Next to vimentin, CD34 was the most prevalent antigen, followed by markers of neural and muscular differentiation. Many tumors exhibited a mixed phenotype. Twenty-one tumors were diploid, eight hypodiploid, and 23 aneuploid. In univariate analysis, tumor grade, Ki-S5 labeling index, mitotic count, atypical mitoses, cellularity, and sex were predictive of both mortality and metastasis risk. DNA ploidy only correlated with overall survival, whereas the tumor location affected the occurrence of metastases. Multivariate analysis selected Ki-S5 scores (P {$<$} .0001) and atypical mitoses (P=.012) as independent prognosticators for overall survival, and tumor grade (P=.0036) and size (P=.0055) as predictors of metastatic spread. We conclude that GIST are primitive mesenchymal tumors capable of divergent differentiation, which does not influence their prognosis. The latter appears to be best predicted by histopathologic grading and the Ki-67 labeling index.},

  abstract = {Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion. KEY POINTS: Slow breathing practices have gained popularity in the western world due to their claimed health benefits, yet remain relatively untouched by the medical community.Investigations into the physiological effects of slow breathing have uncovered significant effects on the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems.Key findings include effects on respiratory muscle activity, ventilation efficiency, chemoreflex and baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, blood flow dynamics, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, cardiorespiratory coupling, and sympathovagal balance.There appears to be potential for use of controlled slow breathing techniques as a means of optimising physiological parameters that appear to be associated with health and longevity, and that may extend to disease states; however, there is a dire need for further research into the area. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To provide a comprehensive overview of normal human respiratory physiology and the documented effects of slow breathing in healthy humans.To review and discuss the evidence and hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying slow breathing physiological effects in humans.To provide a definition of slow breathing and what may constitute "autonomically optimised respiration".To open discussion on the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques and the need for further research.},

  abstract = {This article studies the struggle between classes in George Orwell's novel Animal Farm (1945). The most suitable school of literary criticism to tackle such a subject is that of Marxism. Two basic Marxist principles are at the center of the study: class conflict and the notion of base and superstructure. The article addresses the ongoing class conflict occurring at the base between humans and pigs on the one hand and lower-class animals on the other. Three main questions have been addressed: In what ways does the upper class oppress the lower? How does the lower class respond? What is the outcome of the struggle? The study uncovers the major factors that allow the upper class to overcome the lower in Animal Farm. The lower-class response consists of both constructive and destructive attitudes. The balance is ultimately tipped towards authoritarianism, leading the animals to live in conditions worse than those of the pre-revolutionary period.},

A significant amount of work has been devoted to metal complexes that act on DNA. In this area, focus has been on ruthenium and rhodium polypyridyl compounds, but copper, iron, cobalt, and vanadium complexes also find increasing application as photoactivable DNA cleaving agents, with excitation sometimes even possible in the near IR region. Most often, the activity of these systems is based on the formation of reactive radical species. Another promising approach is the photochemical generation of covalent DNA binders from inactive precursors, as, for example, by some platinum(IV) compounds. The photolytic liberation of biologically active small molecules from inactive metal complex precursors has also become the target of recent research efforts and complements work on purely organic ``caged'' compounds. The significant progress made on light-induced liberation of neurotransmitters as well as small molecule messengers like nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO) is also summarized here.},

Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Microbial fermentation is a common form of metabolism that has been exploited by humans to great benefit. Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. About one-third of the world's food is fermented, and the brewing of fermented beverages in particular has an ancient and storied history. Because fermentation is so intertwined with our daily lives, the topic is easily relatable to students interested in real-world applications for microbiology. Here, we describe the curriculum for a guided inquiry-based laboratory course that combines yeast molecular ecology and brewing. The rationale for the course is to compare commercial               Saccharomyces cerevisiae               yeast strains, which have been domesticated through thousands of generations of selection, with wild yeast, where there is growing interest in their potentially unique brewing characteristics. Because wild yeasts are so easy to isolate, identify, and characterize, this is a great opportunity to present key concepts in molecular ecology and genetics in a way that is relevant and accessible to students. We organized the course around three main modules: isolation and identification of wild yeast, phenotypic characterization of wild and commercial ale yeast strains, and scientific design of a brewing recipe and head-to-head comparison of the performance of a commercial and wild yeast strain in the brewing process. Pre- and postassessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the course, and students enjoyed connecting microbiology to a real-world application.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In the last step of glycolysis Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the irreversible conversion of ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate to ATP and pyruvic acid, both crucial for cellular metabolism. Thus pyruvate kinase plays a key role in controlling the metabolic flux and ATP production. The hallmark of the activity of different pyruvate kinases is their tight modulation by a variety of mechanisms including the use of a large number of physiological allosteric effectors in addition to their homotropic regulation by phosphoenolpyruvate. Binding of effectors signals precise and orchestrated movements in selected areas of the protein structure that alter the catalytic action of these evolutionarily conserved enzymes with remarkably conserved architecture and sequences. While the diverse nature of the allosteric effectors has been discussed in the literature, the structural basis of their regulatory effects is still not well understood because of the lack of data representing conformations in various activation states. Results of recent studies on pyruvate kinases of different families suggest that members of evolutionarily related families follow somewhat conserved allosteric strategies but evolutionarily distant members adopt different strategies. Here we review the structure and allosteric properties of pyruvate kinases of different families for which structural data are available.},

It is stable in the dark, but undergoes photodecomposition more rapidly than the Pt(IV) parent complex (Pt-OH) to generate Pt(II) species, an azidyl radical and 1O2. The Ir(III)* excited state, formed after irradiation, can oxidise NADH to NAD* radicals and NAD+. Pt-Ir is highly photocytotoxic towards cancer cells with a high photocytotoxicity index upon irradiation with blue light (465 nm, 4.8 mW/cm2), even with short lightexposure times (10--60 min). In contrast, the mononuclear Pt-OH and Ir-NH2 subunits and their simple mixture are much less potent. Cellular Pt accumulation was higher for Pt-Ir compared to Pt-OH. Irradiation of Pt-Ir in cancer cells damages nuclei and releases chromosomes. Synchrotron-XRF revealed ca. 4{\texttimes} higher levels of intracellular platinum compared to iridium in Pt-Ir treated cells under dark conditions. Luminescent Pt-Ir distributes over the whole cell and generates ROS and 1O2 within 1 h of irradiation. Iridium localises strongly in small compartments, suggestive of complex cleavage and excretion via recycling vesicles (e.g. lysosomes). The combination of PDT and PACT motifs in one molecule, provides Pt-Ir with a novel strategy for multimodal phototherapy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The egg structure of sturgeon is complex, with multiple micropyles and an envelope structure different from that of teleosts and other fish groups. In the sturgeon, an adhesive layer in the follicular epithelium is responsible for the egg adhesiveness. This is a problem for artificial reproduction of many fish species, including sturgeon, when a large number of eggs are incubated in hatchery conditions. Although several techniques for removing adhesiveness have been developed and successfully applied to eggs of common carp, tench, pikeperch and European catfish, de-sticking methods for sturgeon are limited. Proteolytic enzymes have been successfully applied to common carp, tench and African catfish eggs, leading to a hatching rate over 80\% following 2-min treatment. In sturgeon, blue clay is the most commonly used de-sticking substance. The chemical reactions determining egg adhesiveness in sturgeon are poorly studied, and optimum methods for removing stickiness remain to be developed.},

  abstract = {Nanotechnology is a very disruptive twenty-first-century revolution that will allow social and economic welfare to increase although it also involves a significant human exposure to nanoparticles. The aim of the present study was to contribute to the elucidation on whether metallic nanoparticles have a potential to induce fertility impairments. Regulatory studies that observed official OECD guidelines 415, 416 and 422 have failed to detect any fertility alterations caused by nanoparticle exposure. However, the scientific literature provides evidence that some nanoparticles may cause gonad impairments although the actual impact on fertility remains uncertain. This aim of the present study is to revisit the previously published RNAseq studies by analyzing the effects of several nanoparticles on the transcriptome of T98G human glioblastoma cells given that glial cells are known to play a pivotal role in the regulation of gonadotropin releasing hormone neurons. We found evidence that nanoparticles impair the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor pathway and several related biological process like, among others, the cellular response to follicular stimulating hormone, cellular response to gonadotropin stimulus, cellular response to hormone stimulus, response to steroid hormone, ovulation cycle and response to estradiol. We propose that nanoparticles interfere with the ability of glial cells to regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons and, subsequently, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, potentially leading to fertility impairments. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a mode of action based on endocrine disruption for explaining the possible effects of nanoparticles on fertility. Whether these finding can be extended to other types of nanoparticles requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) result in misfolding and aggregation of the protein, causing neurodegenerative amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, several new SOD1 variants that trigger ALS have been identified, making it increasingly crucial to understand the SOD1 toxicity pathway in ALS. Here we used an integrated bioinformatics approach, including the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool to analyze signaling pathways, regulators, functions, and network molecules of SOD1 with an emphasis on ALS. IPA toxicity analysis of SOD1 identified superoxide radicals' degradation, apelin adipocyte, ALS, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response, and sirtuin signaling as the key signaling pathways, while the toxicity of SOD1 is exerted via mitochondrial swelling and oxidative stress. IPA listed CNR1, APLN, BTG2, MAPK, DRAP1, NFE2L2, SNCA, and CG as the upstream regulators of SOD1. IPA further revealed that mutation in SOD1 results in hereditary disorders, including ALS. The exploration of the relationship between SOD1 and ALS using IPA unveiled SOD1-ALS pathway molecules. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of SOD1-ALS pathway molecules with ShinyGO reaffirmed that SOD1 toxicity results in ALS and neurodegeneration. The GO analysis further identified enriched biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components for SOD1-ALS pathway molecules. The construction of a protein--protein interaction network of SOD1-ALS pathway molecules using STRING and further analysis of that network with Cytoscape identified ACTB followed by TP53, IL6, CASP3, SOD1, IL1B, APP, APOE, and VEGFA as the major network hubs. Taken together, our study provides insight into the molecular underpinning of SOD1's toxicity in ALS.},

In PSII, the protein components that are involved in the Mn               4               CaO               5               cluster or the proceeding proton-transfer pathway facilitate electron transfer along the active branch. In PbRC, most of these components are not conserved and polar residues on the active side facilitate electron transfer. The energy profile suggests that the initial electron donor differs between PbRC and PSII. It seems likely that the acquirement of oxygen-evolving ability alters the protein environment near the accessory chlorophyll and makes it the initial electron donor in PSII.                        ,                             In photosynthetic reaction centers from purple bacteria (PbRC) and the water-oxidizing enzyme, photosystem II (PSII), charge separation occurs along one of the two symmetrical electron-transfer branches. Here we report the microscopic origin of the unidirectional charge separation, fully considering electron--hole interaction, electronic coupling of the pigments, and electrostatic interaction with the polarizable entire protein environments. The electronic coupling between the pair of bacteriochlorophylls is large in PbRC, forming a delocalized excited state with the lowest excitation energy (i.e., the special pair). The charge-separated state in the active branch is stabilized by uncharged polar residues in the transmembrane region and charged residues on the cytochrome               c               2               binding surface. In contrast, the accessory chlorophyll in the D1 protein (Chl               D1               ) has the lowest excitation energy in PSII. The charge-separated state involves Chl               D1               {$\bullet$}+               and is stabilized predominantly by charged residues near the Mn               4               CaO               5               cluster and the proceeding proton-transfer pathway.

During 2005 and 2006, we sampled adult and age-0 shovelnose sturgeon to link age at maturation, the timing and periodicity of spawning, age-0 sturgeon production, and the resulting age-0 growth rates. Age at maturity was later than previous estimates, the minimum age of first maturation being 8 years for males and 9 years for females. Total egg count was slightly lower than previously reported (mean = 29,573 per female; SE = 2,472). Males and females typically spawned every 2 and 3 years, respectively. Peaks in mature fish coincided with rising river stages and water temperatures at which shovelnose sturgeon probably spawn. Peaks in spent adults followed. Age-0 shovelnose sturgeon occurred during June and July 2005 and May and June 2006, confirming successful spawning. Age-0 sturgeon grew between 0.69 and 1.69 mm total length/d; four distinct weekly cohorts occurred each year. During fall 2006, females contained ripe eggs, males were milting, and a single age-0 sturgeon (total length = 55 mm) was captured, suggesting that shovelnose sturgeon spawn during fall as well as spring. Management must consider the protracted nature of spawning within seasons as well as differences in spawning activity between seasons.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria constitute the only phylum of oxygen-evolving photosynthetic prokaryotes that shaped the oxygenic atmosphere of our planet. Over time, cyanobacteria have evolved as a widely diverse group of organisms that have colonized most aquatic and soil ecosystems of our planet and constitute a large proportion of the biomass that sustains the biosphere. Cyanobacteria synthesize a vast array of biologically active metabolites that are of great interest for human health and industry, and several model cyanobacteria can be genetically manipulated. Hence, cyanobacteria are regarded as promising microbial factories for the production of chemicals from highly abundant natural resources, e.g., solar energy, CO2, minerals, and waters, eventually coupled to wastewater treatment to save costs. In this review, we summarize new important discoveries on the plasticity of the photoautotrophic metabolism of cyanobacteria, emphasizing the coordinated partitioning of carbon and nitrogen towards growth or compound storage, and the importance of these processes for biotechnological perspectives. We also emphasize the importance of redox regulation (including glutathionylation) on these processes, a subject which has often been overlooked.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care and is often managed with opioid analgesics; however, opioids may cause respiratory depression by suppressing various components of respiration. Respiration is the physiological process that facilitates gas exchange and is mediated through the proper function of and communication among central neural control (respiratory drive), sensory input systems, the lungs, and the muscles involved in respiration. Normal respiratory function can be dampened with the use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants and/or underlying health conditions. Patients with chronic pain are often exposed to CNS depressants other than opioids, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, and ethanol, which can function synergistically with opioids to increase the risk of respiratory depression. Some patients may also have underlying health issues, such as obstructive sleep apnea, that can be exacerbated with the use of opioids and other CNS depressants and further contribute to respiratory depression. Clinicians should have a thorough understanding of respiration, recognize how various CNS depressants suppress it, and take necessary steps to mitigate the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression by collaborating with a multidisciplinary team (i.e., sleep and pain specialists), choosing appropriate medications, and educating patients on the proper use and storage of opioids.},

Although significant resources are invested into the conservation and restoration of imperiled sturgeons, the burgeoning commercial culture industry poses an imminent threat to the persistence of many populations. In the past decade, the number and distribution of captive sturgeon facilities has grown exponentially and now encompasses diverse interest groups ranging from hobby aquarists to industrial-scale commercial facilities. Expansion of sturgeon captive culture has largely fallen outside the purview of existing regulatory frameworks, raising concerns that continued growth of this industry has real potential to jeopardize conservation of global sturgeon populations. Here, we highlight some of the most significant threats commercial culture poses to wild populations, with particular emphasis on how releases can accelerate wild population declines through mechanisms such as hybridization, introgression, competition, and disease transmission. We also note that in some circumstances, commercial captive culture has continued to motivate harvest of wild populations, potentially accelerating species' declines. Given the prevalence and trajectory of sturgeon captive culture programs, we comment on modifications to regulatory frameworks that could improve the ability of captive culture to support wild sturgeon conservation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Few proteins have come under such intense scrutiny as superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). For almost a century, scientists have dissected its form, function and then later its malfunction in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We now know SOD1 is a zinc and copper metalloenzyme that clears superoxide as part of our antioxidant defence and respiratory regulation systems. The possibility of reduced structural integrity was suggested by the first crystal structures of human SOD1 even before deleterious mutations in the               sod1               gene were linked to the ALS. This concept evolved in the intervening years as an impressive array of biophysical studies examined the characteristics of mutant SOD1 in great detail. We now recognise how ALS-related mutations perturb the SOD1 maturation processes, reduce its ability to fold and reduce its thermal stability and half-life. Mutant SOD1 is therefore predisposed to monomerisation, non-canonical self-interactions, the formation of small misfolded oligomers and ultimately accumulation in the tell-tale insoluble inclusions found within the neurons of ALS patients. We have also seen that several post-translational modifications could push wild-type SOD1 down this toxic pathway. Recently we have come to view ALS as a prion-like disease where both the symptoms, and indeed SOD1 misfolding itself, are transmitted to neighbouring cells. This raises the possibility of intervention after the initial disease presentation. Several small-molecule and biologic-based strategies have been devised which directly target the SOD1 molecule to change the behaviour thought to be responsible for ALS. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the many biophysical advances that sculpted our view of SOD1 biology and the recent work that aims to apply this knowledge for therapeutic outcomes in ALS.},

The singlet oxygen production of the conjugates was evaluated through a 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran method. The targeting ability and subcellular localization of Por 4 were confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy in HeLa cells (overexpression of FR) as well as in A549 cells (low expression of FR). The results suggested that the modification of the carboxyl group with a porphyrin compound did not decrease the binding affinity of folic acid to FR positive cancer cells. Moreover, the MTT assay using HeLa cells and A549 cells verified the low cytotoxicity of Por 4 in the dark. Upon irradiation, Por 4 showed noticeable improvement in toxicity against cancer cells with the overexpression of FR. Upon the treatment of Por 4 at the concentration of 20 {$\mu$}M, the cell viability was determined as 22\% and 75\% for HeLa and A549 cells, respectively, indicating that the folate-conjugated platinum porphyrin complex could be a promising PDT agent for cancer with overexpression of the folate receptor.},

  abstract = {Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is ubiquitously expressed and the predominant dismutase in the cytoplasm. Whereas transcriptional regulation of the SOD1 gene has been well characterized, posttranscriptional regulation of the gene remains largely unknown in eukaryotes. In this study, a full-length 3'UTR of the SOD1 transcript was cloned and characterized for its ability to regulate SOD1 gene expression in human cancer cells. Inclusion of the SOD1 3'UTR in the pGL3 reporter construct dramatically enhanced the reporter activity by 10- to 220-fold in various cell lines. RT-PCR analysis, however, indicated that the reporter gene mRNA levels were only modestly altered by the SOD1 3'UTR, suggesting that the SOD1 3'UTR enhances the reporter gene activity not simply by stabilizing the mRNA but primarily by promoting translation of the protein. Bioinformatics analysis showed multiple stem and loop structures of the SOD1 3'UTR, and alterations in this secondary structure led to remarkably reduced reporter gene activity. Importantly, introducing the SOD1 3'UTR into cancer cells attenuated endogenous SOD1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating the involvement of RNA trans-acting factors in this process. Using siRNA and RNA immunoprecipitation techniques, we identified AUF-1, an RNA-binding protein, as a positive regulator of SOD1 expression through its 3'UTR. Consequently, AUF-1 was found to regulate redox balance in our cell model systems. Furthermore, in human ovarian, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer tissues, the expression of SOD1 was significantly correlated with that of AUF-1, further supporting the importance of AUF-1 in regulating SOD1 gene expression.},

Photoactivatable Pt(IV) prodrugs offer the potential of targeted drug release and new mechanisms of action. We report the synthesis, X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic properties of photoactivatable diazido complexes trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3)2(OH)2(MA)(Py)] (1; MA=methylamine, Py=pyridine) and trans,trans,trans-[Pt(N3)2(OH)2(MA)(Tz)] (2; Tz=thiazole), and interpret their photophysical properties by TD-DFT modelling. The orientation of the azido groups is highly dependent on H\>bonding and crystal packing, as shown by polymorphs 1p and 1q. Complexes 1 and 2 are stable in the dark towards hydrolysis and glutathione reduction, but undergo rapid photoreduction with UVA or blue light with minimal amine photodissociation. They are over an order of magnitude more potent towards HaCaT keratinocytes, A2780 ovarian, and OE19 oesophageal carcinoma cells than cisplatin and show particular potency towards cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells (A2780cis). Analysis of binding to calf-thymus (CT), plasmids, oligonucleotide DNA and individual nucleotides reveals that photoactivated 1 and 2 form both mono- and bifunctional DNA lesions, with preference for G and C, similar to transplatin, but with significantly larger unwinding angles and a higher percentage of interstrand cross-links, with evidence for DNA strand cross-linking further supported by a comet assay. DNA lesions of 1 and 2 on a 50\>bp duplex were not recognised by HMGB1 protein, in contrast to cisplatin-type lesions. The photo-induced platination reactions of DNA by 1 and 2 show similarities with the products of the dark reactions of the Pt(II) compounds trans-[PtCl2(MA)(Py)] (5) and trans-[PtCl2(MA)(Tz)] (6). Following photoactivation, complex 2 reacted most rapidly with CT DNA, followed by 1, whereas the dark reactions of 5 and 6 with DNA were comparatively slow. Complexes 1 and 2 can therefore give rapid potent photocytotoxicity and novel DNA lesions in cancer cells, with no activity in the absence of irradiation.},

Our approach could enable the room temperature storage of genomic information in book-size format for more than one thousand years (thermally equivalent), costing only 0.5 \$/person.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria are blue-green Gram-negative and photosynthetic bacteria which are seen as one of the most morphologically numerous groups of prokaryotes. Because of their ability to fix gaseous nitrogen and carbon dioxide to organic materials, they are known to play important roles in the universal nutrient cycle. Cyanobacteria has emerged as one of the promising resources to combat the issues of global warming, disease outbreaks, nutrition insecurity, energy crises as well as persistent daily human population increases. Cyanobacteria possess significant levels of macro and micronutrient substances which facilitate the versatile popularity to be utilized as human food and protein supplements in many countries such as Asia. Cyanobacteria has been employed as a complementary dietary constituent of feed for poultry and as vitamin and protein supplement in aquatic lives. They are effectively used to deal with numerous tasks in various fields of biotechnology, such as agricultural (including aquaculture), industrial (food and dairy products), environmental (pollution control), biofuel (bioenergy) and pharmaceutical biotechnology (such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, anticoagulant and antitumor); recently, the growing interest of applying them as biocatalysts has been observed as well. Cyanobacteria are known to generate a numerous variety of bioactive compounds. However, the versatile potential applications of cyanobacteria in biotechnology could be their significant growth rate and survival in severe environmental conditions due to their distinct and unique metabolic pathways as well as active defensive mechanisms. In this review, we elaborated on the versatile cyanobacteria applications in different areas of biotechnology. We also emphasized the factors that could impede the implementation to cyanobacteria applications in biotechnology and the execution of strategies to enhance their effective applications.},
