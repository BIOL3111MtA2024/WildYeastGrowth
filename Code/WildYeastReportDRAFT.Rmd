# Introduction

## Aim and Objectives

- This experiment aims to isolate wild yeast from the bark and leaves of oak trees and the fruit and bark of apple trees. 
- We tested wild yeast strains against commercial yeast for the rate of alcohol production, alcohol tolerance, varied culturing temperatures, and the qualitative observations of strains during isolation.
- We successfully isolated yeast from apple tree bark, oak tree leaves, and brewer yeast. 
- We were not successful in isolating yeast from the apple fruit, oak tree bark and the negative control (air) samples.

## Hypothesis

- We hypothesize that commercial yeast will outperform the wild yeast strains in alcohol production rate and alcohol tolerance [@scholesWildYeastLaboratory2021]. 
- We also hypothesize that commercial yeast will be more viable than the wild yeast strains [@scholesWildYeastLaboratory2021].

## We tested the following:

- Viability (%) of the isolated yeast strains.
- The specific gravity from the brew of each yeast strain isolated.
- Alcohol tolerance of the yeast strains.

## Intial R Setup

### Set chunk options
Formatted display of content from .md file on GitHub site.
Upon knitting, figures will be saved to 'Figs/'.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='Figs/')
```

### Load packages
```{r packages, include = FALSE}
# Install the googlesheets4 package if not already installed
# install.packages("googlesheets4")
library(tidyverse) #core packages from Tidyverse
library(googledrive) #access to GoogleDrive
library(googlesheets4) #access to GoogleSheets

# Yeast Viability Analysis


## The percent of living yeast compared to total yeast counts and the culturing conditions of the isolated yeast.
- Viability is the percent of living cells within a given sample.
- YM grown at 37 °C are the optimum culturing conditions for obtaining the greatest yeast viability.
```{r Viability Percent by Sample ID}

# Analysis of Ethanol Tolerance in Wild and Commerical Yeast Strains 

Methods done as instructed by [@yingIsolationIdentificationTolerance2024].


### Settings for file import of raw ODData

- Note: The .tsv file exported from the Molecular Dynamics software with encoding UTF16LE had embedded null characters that caused problems upon import.
- As a hacked solution, download the .tsv from 'Teams'.
- Import the .tsv into a new GoogleSheet.
- Delete the first two rows of the file.
- Export from GoogleSheet as .csv.
- Move the .csv to the .Rproj folder.
- A better way would be code to read the problematic UTF16LE file with null characters.
- The issue relates to a complex file structure exported from Molecular Dynamics software.
```{r variable names for file import & processing MOLECULAR DEVICES}
Project <- "WildYeast"

#set variables for file import & processing
DataPath <- file.path("..", "Data", "RawData", fsep = .Platform$file.sep)
file_id <- ".csv"

# DataOneDrive <- "~/OneDrive - Mount Allison University/BIOL2201_2024/StudentDataTest"

```

### List Data file(s) before reading in raw ODData
```{r datafiles}
DataFiles <- list.files(path = DataPath, pattern = file_id, full.names = TRUE)

DataFiles

FileEncodeMD <- as.character(guess_encoding(file = DataFiles[1])[1,1])
FileEncodeMD
```

### Read ODData file(s) into form readable by R
```{r dataread}
ODData <- readr::read_csv(file =  DataFiles[1])

#head(ODData)


#data.table::fread(text = readLines(DataFiles[1], skipNul = T))


```


```{r read all files}
#code for reading multiple files, if needed
# read_delim_plus <- function(flnm, delimiter, headerrows, fileencode){read_delim(flnm, delim = delimiter,  col_names = TRUE,  skip = headerrows, escape_double = FALSE,  locale = locale(encoding = fileencode), trim_ws = TRUE) |>
#     mutate(Filename = flnm)
#   }
# 
# ODData <- DataFiles |>
#   map_df(~read_delim_plus(flnm = ., delimiter = DelimiterMD,  headerrows = HeaderRowsMD,  fileencode = FileEncodeMD))
# 
# head(ODData)
```

### Molecular Dynamics exports problematic variable names. In this case, 'temperature' had to be renamed.
```{r variable names}
#colnames(ODData)
```

```{r rename varible}
# Rename column using pattern matching
ODData <- ODData %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("Temperature.*", "TempC", .x))  # Replace any name starting with "Temperature"
```


```{r verify rename worked}
#head(ODData)
```

### Labels for OD680 & OD720 were lost in hacked import; in this chunk, they were regenerated.
```{r OD labels}

#remove blank rows by filtering out rows where Temp_C is NA
ODData <- ODData |>
  filter(!is.na(TempC))

#this is a hack solution, knowing there are only 15 rows of data
#better way would be to keep the OD settings during import
ODData <- ODData |>
  mutate(nm = ifelse(row_number() %in% c(1:15), 680, 720), .before = Time)

#head(ODData)
```


### For plotting, it is easier to have data in a 'long' format, where the Well becomes a value of a variable rather than a separate variable for each well.
```{r ODData long}
ODDataLong <- pivot_longer(ODData, cols = -c(nm, Time, TempC), names_to = "Well", values_to = "OD")

#ODDataLong |>
  #ggplot() +
  #geom_point(aes(x = Time, y = OD)) +
  #facet_grid(cols = vars(nm))

#head(ODDataLong)
```


### ODData was saved in the long format as a 'rds' file,
```{r save rds}
saveRDS(ODDataLong, file = file.path("..", "Data", "ProcessedData", "ODDataLong.rds"))
```

### Converted time from h:m:s format to numeric format (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 etc.). This is necessary for ethanol tolerance analyses.
```{r}
ODDataLong <- ODDataLong %>% 
  mutate(Time_numeric = as.numeric(hms(Time)) / 3600)  # Converts to hours
```

### Merge ODDataLong with Metadata before attempting data analyses.
```{r Merge ODData with Metadata}
# Merge ODData with ATMetaData
Merged_ATData <- ODDataLong %>%
  left_join(ATMetaData, by = "Well")
#View(Merged_ATData)
```

### Filter wells that had no media/inoculant to avoid problems in analysis.
```{r Filter NA Results}

# Exclude wells G10, G11, G12, H10, H11, H12
Merged_ATData <- Merged_ATData %>%
  filter(!Well %in% c("G10", "G11", "G12", "H10", "H11", "H12"))

# Verify
# table(Merged_ATData$Well) 
```

### Filter merged data by wavelength inorder to make  growth curves for OD720 and OD680.
```{r Filter Data by nm}
# Filter data for OD 680 nm
Merged_ATData_680 <- Merged_ATData %>%
  filter(nm == 680)

# Filter data for OD 720 nm
Merged_ATData_720 <- Merged_ATData %>%
  filter(nm == 720)
```

### Double check data is in time numeric form for analyses.
```{r Convert to time numeric}
Merged_ATData <- Merged_ATData %>% 
  mutate(Time_hour = as.numeric(hms(Time)) / 3600)  # Converts to hours
```

### Verify structure prior to spline test for MuMax, problematic structure, will cause problems.
```{r Verify Merged_ATData Structure}
# Verify dataset structure
# str(Merged_ATData)  
# head(Merged_ATData) 
```

## The change in absorbance at 680 nm over 14 hours of each stain when exposed to varying ethanol concentrations of 2 – 12 % (v/v).
```{r Growth Curves at OD680}
Merged_ATData <- Merged_ATData %>%
mutate(EthanolConcentrationLabel = factor(paste0(EthanolConcentration, "% (v/v)"), levels = paste0(sort(unique(EthanolConcentration)), "% (v/v)")))

Merged_ATData |>

```

## The change in absorbance at 720 nm over 14 hours of each stain when exposed to varying ethanol concentrations of 2 – 12 % (v/v).

```{r Growth Curves at OD720}
Merged_ATData <- Merged_ATData %>%
mutate(EthanolConcentrationLabel = factor(paste0(EthanolConcentration, "% (v/v)"), levels = paste0(sort(unique(EthanolConcentration)), "% (v/v)")))

Merged_ATData |>

```

### Spline fitting for determining maximum growth rate (MuMax (hours)) and R-squared for all tested conditions and yeast strains (ie. wells).
```{r Run splines test for MuMax and R-squared}

# Step 2: Spline Fitting and Parameter Extraction
SplineRates_nest <- Merged_ATData |> 
  group_by(nm, Well, Source, SampleID, EthanolConcentration, BrothType, GrowthTempC) |> 
  nest() |> 
  mutate(SplineFit = purrr::map(data, ~tryCatch(
      growthrates::fit_spline(.$Time_hour, .$OD),  # Fit spline
      error = function(e) NULL  # Handle errors gracefully
    )), # Fit spline with error handling
Mumax_hour = purrr::map_dbl(SplineFit, ~if (!is.null(.)) pluck(., "par", "mumax") else NA_real_),  
    rsquared = purrr::map_dbl(SplineFit, ~if (!is.null(.)) pluck(., "rsquared") else NA_real_))|> 
  ungroup()

SplineRatesResults <- SplineRates_nest |> 
  select(nm, Well, Mumax_hour, rsquared, Source, SampleID, EthanolConcentration, BrothType, GrowthTempC)

# View the results
# print(SplineRatesResults)

```

### Cleaned the resulting "SplineRatesResults", before plotting MuMax (hours) vs EtOH concentration (% v/v).
```{r Filter NA values}
# Remove rows with any NA values
SplineRatesResults <- na.omit(SplineRatesResults)

# Check the result
# head(SplineRatesResults)

#View(SplineRatesResults)

```

### Fit linear models from cleaned "SplineRatesResults".
```{r Fit Linear Models}
#define exponential decay function for data fitting.
#exp_decay <- function(x, i, mu){y = i * exp(mu * x)}

#need to merge left_join(Merged_ATMetaData_MuMax_clean, true MetaData so you can talk about growth responses to EtOH in a sensible manner
 # left_join(Merged_ATMetaData_MuMax_clean, 

MuEtOH_nest <- SplineRatesResults |>
  nest(.by = c("SampleID", "nm", "Source", "BrothType", "GrowthTempC")) |> #want to nest by source
  mutate(LinearFit = purrr::map(data, ~lm(Mumax_hour ~ EthanolConcentration,
                                            data = .x)),
         LinearTidy = purrr::map(LinearFit, tidy),
         LinearParam = purrr::map(LinearFit, glance),
         LinearPredict = purrr::map(LinearFit, augment))
```
 
## The relationship between MuMax (hours) ethanol concentration (% v/v) of the isolated yeast strains, faceted by source and culturing conditions.

```{r plot mumax vs EtOh}
#Set label for GrowthTempC
temp_labeller <- function(value) {
  paste(value, "°C")
}
nm_labeller <- function(value) {
  paste(value, "nm")
}
#Plot Linear model
MuEtOH_nest |>
  unnest(cols = c(LinearPredict)) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = EthanolConcentration, y = Mumax_hour)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = EthanolConcentration , y = .fitted)) +
  #geom_point(aes(x = Ethanol (v/v %), y = .resid), colour = "red") +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(Source, BrothType, GrowthTempC), rows = vars(nm), labeller = labeller(GrowthTempC = temp_labeller , nm = nm_labeller)) +
   labs(x = "Ethanol Concentration % (v/v)") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Show fit parameters.

- These parameters show that the relationships plotted above are statically significant (very small p-values).
```{r show mumax vs EtOH fit parameters}

# Analysis of Fermentation Capabilities Between Wild and Commercial Yeast Strains.


## The change in specific gravity during the 7-day brewing process of each yeast strain and the culturing conditions of the isolated yeast. 

- Lag phase of 4 days for the yeast from apple tree bark, oak leaves 3 days and 1 day for the brewer yeast.
- Brewer yeast is the only stain which appears to have reached the end point of the brew.
- Culturing conditions appear to have little to no effect on fermenting capabilities.

## The percent of sugar consumed referred to the apparent attenuation by the yeast strains from the initial malt, facted by source and culturing conditions.

- Finding out the attenuation of the sample this will identify the efficiency of the yeast strain by comparing the sugar content in the initial wort to the amount of sugars left over giving a percent of sugars consumed and converted to alcohol or CO2.
- Culturing conditions have little to no effect on the amount of sugars consumed.
- Brewer yeast consumed significantly more sugar due to the prolonged lag phase of apple tree bark and oak leaf yeast, and the brew had not reached completion.

# Summary

- We successfully isolated yeast from apple tree bark, oak tree leaves, and brewer yeast. 
- We were not successful in isolating yeast from the apple fruit, oak tree bark and the negative control (air) samples.

## We tested the following:

- Viability (%) of the isolated yeast strains.
- The specific gravity from the brew of each yeast strain isolated.
- Alcohol tolerance of the yeast strains.
- In varying culturing conditions (YM/YPD and 20/37 degree Celsius)

##Our findings fully or partially support our initial hypotheses:

Initial Hypothesis: Commercial yeast will outperform the wild yeast strains in alcohol production rate and alcohol tolerance [@scholesWildYeastLaboratory2021]. 
- They had a lower lag phase, however, since the wild strains were not allowed to reach completion we cannot fully compare alcohol production rates.
- The commercial yeast performed well in the alcohol tolerance study, but do to the minimal growth of the wild yeast strains we could not compared these results effectively

Initial Hypothesis: Commercial yeast will be more viable than the wild yeast strains [@scholesWildYeastLaboratory2021].
- Commercial yeast were more viable than the OakLeaves strain, but were less viable then the AppleTreeBark strain.

- YM and 37 degree Celsius were found to be the ideal growth conditions for all isolated strains.
